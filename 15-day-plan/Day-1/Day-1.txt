Topic-1: React and its core components:

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for
single-page applications. It's maintained by Facebook and a community of
individual developers and companies. React allows developers to create large 
web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data 
changes.

Here are some of its core concepts:

Components: React code is made of entities called components. 
Components are JavaScript classes or functions that optionally accept inputs, 
i.e., properties (props), and return a React element that describes how a section
of the UI should appear.

The Virtual DOM: React maintains a lightweight representation of the real DOM 
in memory, and that is known as the virtual DOM. When the state of an object 
changes, React updates the virtual DOM as opposed to the real DOM.

JSX: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that is used to describe what the 
UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with
the full power of JavaScript.

State & Props: State is a data structure that starts with a default value when a 
component mounts. It may be mutated across time, mostly as a result of user events. 
Props (short for properties) are a way of passing data from parent to child components.

Lifecycle Methods: Lifecycle methods are special methods that automatically get 
called as your component gets rendered, updated, and unmounted.

Hooks: Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8 that let you use state and other 
React features without writing a class. Hooks are functions that let you 
“hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components.

Topic-2: Set up a basic React development environment.

To set up a basic React development environment, you will need Node.js, npm, 
and the Create React App command line tool. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Install Node.js and npm: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to 
run JavaScript on your server or your machine. npm is a package manager for 
Node.js. You can download Node.js and npm from the official Node.js website.

2. Install Create React App: Create React App is a command line tool that helps 
you create new React.js applications. You can install it globally on your 
machine using npm.

3. Create a new React application: Use the Create React App command line tool 
to create a new React application.

Here's the corresponding code:

# Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
# Visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and follow the instructions

# Step 2: Install Create React App
npm install -g create-react-app

# Step 3: Create a new React application
npx create-react-app my-app

# Step 4: Change into the new app directory
cd my-app

# Step 5: Start the application
npm start

After running these commands, your basic React development environment should be 
set up. You can now start developing your React application.

Topic-3 : Create a "Hello World" React application.

To create a "Hello World" React application, you can use the Create React App tool that you installed earlier. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Create a new React application using Create React App.
Navigate into the new application's directory.
Open the src/App.js file.
Replace the existing code with a simple "Hello World" component.
Start the application.

import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

Finally, start the application:
npm start
